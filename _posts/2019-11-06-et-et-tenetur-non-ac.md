**Introduction**

The graph above demonstrate the comparison between different data visualizations tools and the programming language. As we can see in the bottom of the pyramid we have low level tools like webGL, canvas, svg etc. that gives greater flexibility and control but not so much productive. While the Raw, Chartio can display specifics graphs highly efficiently while their is no flexibility. i.e. if we need to make some changes that is not pre built in them we will have hard time figuring that out.
